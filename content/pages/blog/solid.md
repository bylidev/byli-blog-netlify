# SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles devised to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and easy to maintain.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change.

We should encapsulate classes based on their responsibilities and avoid having a class that performs too many tasks. A well-known phrase is "Jack of all trades, master of none," which applies to class responsibility. We should create classes that specialize in one subject and have a single responsibility.

## 2. Open/Closed Principle

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

When designing classes, we should anticipate changes and design them in a way that allows for extension without modifying existing code. For example, if we need to add a new shipping method to an order, we should be able to do so without modifying the existing Order class. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

When overriding methods in derived classes, the behavior should be extended rather than completely changed. The methods in the base class should continue to work and be backward compatible when used with instances of the derived classes. Similarly, exceptions should extend parent exceptions to maintain compatibility with existing try-catch blocks.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle

> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Interfaces should be fine-grained and tailored to the specific needs of the clients. Clients should not be burdened with implementing methods they don't need. By segregating interfaces, we can avoid unnecessary dependencies and create more cohesive and maintainable code.

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Low-level modules should not be directly depended upon by high-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling and allows for easier substitution of implementations. High-level modules define the business logic while low-level modules handle the technical details.

By adhering to these SOLID principles, we can create more robust, maintainable, and flexible software systems.
